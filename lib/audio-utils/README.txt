The binaries you download here should work on as many systems as possible.

We can utilise so called static builds.

When adding a new binary check that our supported platforms documentation matches
what the binary is capable of running on.

# FFMPEG notes

Choose a stable version, 64-bit builds only, and choose "Shared" linking.
The shared linking option saves on space, otherwise all resources are embedded into all 
executables.
