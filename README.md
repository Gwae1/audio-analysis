## Description

*QUT Ecoacoustics Analysis Programs* is a software package that can perform a  suite of analyses on audio recordings of
the environment. Although the analyses are intended for long-duration recordings (1 â€“ 24 hours), in fact they
can be performed on any audio file in a format supported by the software. Analysis Programs can:

- calculate of summary and spectral acoustic indices at variable resolutions
- produce long-duration, false-colour, multi-index spectrograms
- calculate critical statistics of annotations downloaded from an Acoustic Workbench
- run various acoustic event recognizers

All the analyses are performed by a single executable file, _AnalysisPrograms.exe_.

# License

This project is very old. We've released the full history for the sake of maintainability and transparency.
Unfortunately this means all code before our open source release is not open sourced.

In practice this should never be a problem. We never use our old code, except for historical purposes, and you never
should need to either.
